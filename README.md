Project Description
This project studies how on-field performance during the NFL post-season, specifically Superbowl wins, affect secondary market sales of NFL personal seat licenses (PSLs). PSLs are one-time fees that transfer stadium seat ownership rights from the team to the licensee, thus enabling the licensee to purchase season tickets. Teams only sell a fixed amount of seat licenses at face value. Since futher PSLs transactions take place on a secondary market, the effect of playoff wins on supply and demand is unclear. In order to meet increased demand, there must be a large group of fans willing to sell their own seat license rights. Post-seasons after playoff appearances and Superbowl wins will be analyzed and compared to trends found within season and non-win post-seasons.
